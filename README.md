# NetworkedStateMachine
A state machine system compatible with Photon PUN 2, featuring a single PhotonView dependency and allowing each element of the system to have its own definable StateView declaration. It offers client-specific control over state synchronization, includes its own internal StateRPC system, and supports both networked and standalone usage.
